GoodNewsEveryone! is a "reactive ability" alert addon.  If will display proc buffs the player should know about for decision making, and abilities that are only available under certain conditions.  GNE! is inspired by OhSnap's design and MSBT's triggers.

h2. Supported class buffs

Please note that "reactive" abilities like "Kill Shot":http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=53351 are not listed here as they are provided by the Blizzard Combat Text events.  Also buffs that the player won't make decisions based on are not tracked by GNE!  For example, "Holy Concentration":http://www.wowhead.com/?search=Holy+Concentration

If you think I've missed an ability for your class and have confirmed that it is not supported as a reactive ability, please open an issue on "Github":http://github.com/tekkub/GoodNewsEveryone/issues
