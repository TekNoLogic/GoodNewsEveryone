[Good News Everyone!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1cap6yETA)

GoodNewsEveryone! is a "reactive ability" alert addon.  If will display proc
buffs the player should know about for decision making, and abilities that are
only available under certain conditions.  GNE! is inspired by OhSnap's design
and MSBT's triggers.

## Supported class buffs

Please note that "reactive" abilities like [Kill
Shot](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=53351) are not listed here as they are
